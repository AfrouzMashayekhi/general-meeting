# Affiliations section. Fabric CA server can be bootstrapped with the
# affiliations specified in this section. Affiliations are specified as maps.
# For example:
#   businessunit1:
#     department1:
#       - team1
#   businessunit2:
#     - department2
#     - department3
#
# Affiliations are hierarchical in nature. In the above example,
# department1 (used as businessunit1.department1) is the child of businessunit1.
# team1 (used as businessunit1.department1.team1) is the child of department1.
# department2 (used as businessunit2.department2) and department3 (businessunit2.department3)
# are children of businessunit2.
# Note: Affiliations are case sensitive except for the non-leaf affiliations
# (like businessunit1, department1, businessunit2) that are specified in the configuration file,
# which are always stored in lower case.
